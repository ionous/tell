Tell: "A yaml-like text format."

# Does this look suspiciously like the yaml overview?
# I have no idea how that could have happened.
What It Is: """
   A way of describing data containing string, number, and boolean values,
   and collections of those values. As in yaml, collections can be
   both key-value mappings, and sequences of values.
   """

What It Is Not: "A subset of yaml."

Can Contain:
    - ["Some javascript-ish values"]
    - [ 5, 2.3, 1e-3, 0x20, "\n", "üêà", "\U0001f408" ]
      # supports c,go,python,etc. style escape codes
